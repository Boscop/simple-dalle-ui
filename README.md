# Vectura.ai - Simple Dall-E3 FrontEnd

This is kind-of-fork of the OpenAI Example WebServer for running request against GPT4 but modified to instead be an UI making Dall-E3 usable via the Enterprise API.

## What are the advantages?
- It's cheaper then the GPT Enterprise and GPT+ subscription
- The output quality is higher because the HD flag can be set by default (otherwise OpenAI decides it based on whatever)
- There is no rate limit (currently OpenAI limits you to a couple of images per hour)
